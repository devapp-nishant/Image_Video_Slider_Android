# Image_Video_Slider_Android
This is the full code to implement image cum video slider. We will implement both in a single slider.<br>
First of we have to make a viewpager2 in the activity where we want to implement the slider.
Then make designs of imageview and videoview in their separate xml files. Create a MediaSliderAdapter class in your project.<br>
After applying all these process just go your activity in which you want to implement the slider and add the media items and set the adapter.<br>

Thankyou
